# Hardware and Software Lab - System Design Class

This repository contains code and resources for the Hardware and Software Lab, a hands-on System Design course. The aim of this class is to explore the integration of hardware and software systems, focusing on practical applications, prototyping, and design principles.

Contents

## The repository is organized as follows:

- â”œâ”€â”€ hardware/              # Hardware design files (e.g., PCB layouts, circuit diagrams, BOMs)
- â”œâ”€â”€ software/              # Codebase for software modules and system integration
- â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ microcontroller/   # Code for microcontroller programming (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/               # Software for desktop or mobile applications interacting with the hardware
- â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/               # API or middleware for hardware-software communication
- â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                  # Documentation, research papers, and study materials
- â”œâ”€â”€ experiments/           # Prototyping and lab experiments
- â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                 # Test scripts and files for validation
- â”œâ”€â”€ tools/                 # Custom scripts and utilities
- â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Repository overview and instructions

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
	â€¢	Hardware: Specify any required hardware components (e.g., microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, development kits).
	â€¢	Software: List the programming languages, IDEs, or tools used (e.g., Python, Arduino IDE, C++, Visual Studio Code).

Installation
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/hardware-software-lab.git
cd hardware-software-lab


	2.	Follow setup instructions for specific directories:
	â€¢	For microcontroller code, see hardware/README.md.
