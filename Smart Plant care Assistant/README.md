## General Overview: Smart Plant Care Assistant
Explanation:
“This project monitors soil moisture, temperature, and ambient light to provide actionable insights for optimal plant care. The system uses sensors to collect data and a display device for real-time feedback.”
	•	Sketch: A basic diagram showing the sensing and display devices. Include physical features like sensor placement, display, enclosure, and buttons.

## Sensor Device
	•	Sketch: Draw a simple diagram showing the sensor device’s components:
	•	Sensors: Soil moisture, temperature, ambient light.
	•	Wireless module: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
	•	Power source: Rechargeable battery.
	•	Enclosure: Portable and weather-resistant.
	•	Description:
“The sensor device collects environmental data using soil moisture, temperature, and ambient light sensors. It sends this data via BLE to the display device. The sensors are powered by a rechargeable battery with USB charging capabilities.”

## Display Device
- Sketch: Include components like:
- Stepper motor-driven needle gauge.
- LED indicators.
- Button for user interactions.
- Enclosure design.
- Description:
“The display device receives data from the sensor device via BLE and visualizes it. A gauge needle shows soil moisture levels, LEDs indicate environmental conditions (e.g., too hot, too dry), and a button allows users to interact with the system. The device is powered by a thoughtfully sized battery with USB charging.”
